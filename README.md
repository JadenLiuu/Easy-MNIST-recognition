# Easy-MNIST-recognition
Implement in tensorflow/ MNIST 0~4/ Easy Deep neural network

**Needed packages**
  - tensorflow
  - numpy

**MNIST 0~4**
  * This repository is a practicing project on tensorflow
  * Training on MNIST but only on digits 0 to 4
  * softmax output layer with five neurons

**Model architecture & Implement details**
  * only 5 hidden layers of 128 neurons.
  * ELU activation function is used in each layers.
  * Adam optimizer 

**Sub-functions**
* we've simply write 3 types of functions for evaluation
  - accuracy function
  - mAP function
  - recall function
